YOU HAVE TO START THE SCRIPT MANUALLY IN THE SCRIPT TAB WHEN YOU START A GAME.

Script mod adds more meaningful disasters to Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic. Note that this script mod is highly experimental.

The script makes the game harder by adding disasters and industrial accidents with an area of effect, e.g., an explosion that sets buildings in its close vicinity on fire.

Disasters added by the mod:
[list]
    [*] Oil and oil products tank explosions caused by vapors.
    [*] Fuel refinery explosions.
    [*] Grain silo explosions.
    [*] Alcohol distillery explosions.
[/list]

Possible future disasters:
[list]
    [*] Chemical plant leaks and explosions.
    [*] Coal mine explosions caused by methane.
[/list]

[h2] Disasters [/h2]

[h3] Fuel Tank Explosion [/h3]

If an oil or fuel tank is full of vapors (less than 80% of the capacity), there is a chance that a fuel tank will explode and will set itself and buildings in the vicinity on fire.

[h3] Grain Silo Explosion [/h3]

Grain silos and warehouses storing grain can explode thanks to grain particles in the air.

[h3] Alcohol Distillery Explosion [/h3]

Ethanol vapors can cause fires in the distilleries.

[h3] Refinery [/h3]

Refineries can explode thanks to all the chemicals and oil products.
