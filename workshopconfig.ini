YOU HAVE TO START THE SCRIPT MANUALLY IN THE SCRIPT TAB WHEN YOU START A GAME.

Script mod adds more meaningful disasters to Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic. Note that this script mod is highly experimental.

The script makes the game harder by adding disasters and industrial accidents with an area of effect, e.g., an explosion that sets buildings in its close vicinity on fire.

Disasters added by the mod:
[list]
    [*] Oil and oil products tank explosions caused by vapors.
[/list]

Possible future disasters:
[list]
    [*] Refinery explosion.
    [*] Chemical plant leaks and explosions.
    [*] Coal mine explosions caused by methane.
[/list]

[h3] Fuel Tank Explosion [/h3]

If an oil or fuel tank is full of vapors (less than 80% of the capacity), there is a chance that a fuel tank will explode and will set itself and buildings in the vicinity on fire.
