# Workers & Resources: Disaster Expanded

Script mod that adds more meaningfull disasters to [Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic][steam_page].
Note that this script mod is highly experimental.

The script makes the game harder by adding explosions that set source building and building
in a close vicinity on fire. This adds an additional challange and considerations when building
harbors, refineries and factory complexex, as it makes it far more dangerous to put buildings
next to each other.

Disasters added by the mod:
* Oil and oil products tank explosions caused by vapors.
  
Possible future disasters:
* Refinery explosion.
* Chemical plant leaks and explosions.
* Coal mine explosions caused by methane.

## Disasters

### Fuel Tank Vapor Explosion

When a fuel tank contains some fuel, bitumen or oil, but less than 50% of its capacity,
there is chance that the vapors will cause an explosion that will put it and buildings
in a close vicinity.
